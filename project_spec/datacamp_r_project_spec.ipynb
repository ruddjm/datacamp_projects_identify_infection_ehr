    "Sepsis is a deadly illness accounting for a large portion of in-hospital deaths. It occurs when a person's organs shut down in response to a severe infection. This public health problem is a major target for research, and hospital records represent a great opportunity for sepsis research. In this R project, you will identify hospital patients with severe infection using medical record data. This project assumes you know how to work with data frames using `data.table`.\n",

    "Sepsis is a deadly syndrome where a patient has a severe infection that causes organ failure. The medical community believes that the sooner septic patients are treated, the more likely they are to survive, but recognizing sepsis is difficult. Now that hospitals have a constant flow of data, it may be possible to use machine learning to automatically flag patients who are likely to be septic. Before any predictive algorithms can be developed, however, we need a reliable way to pick out the patients who had sepsis. \n",
    " \n",
    "In this project, we will find out which patients were suspected to have a severe infection using electronic health record (EHR) data. In other words, we will look in to the hospital's records to see what happened during a patient's hospital stay, and try to figure out whether he or she had a severe infection. We will check to see whether the doctor ordered a blood test to look for bacteria (a blood culture) and also gave the patient a series of antibotics. The basic idea is that a patient starts antibiotics within a couple of days of a blood culture, and is given antibiotics for at least 4 days.\n",

    "### Criteria for Suspected Infection*\n",
    "   * Patient receives antibiotics for a sequence of 4 days, with gaps of 1 day allowed.\n",
    "   * The sequence must start with a “new antibiotic” (not given in the prior 2 days).\n",
    "   * The sequence must start within +/-2 days of a blood culture.  \n",
    "   * There must be at least one IV antibiotic within the +/-2 day window period. (An IV drug is one that is given intravenously, not by mouth.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's take a look at the antibiotic data, which is in a csv file called 'antibiotic.csv.' Let's import it using the `data.table` function for reading in data. Let's look at a few rows of data. Each row represents one time the patient was given a drug. The variables include the patient id, the day the drug was administered, and the type of drug are included. "
